			<h1>Kids, you tried your best and you failed miserably. The lesson is, never try.</h1>
			<p>Slow down, Bart! My legs don't know how to be as long as yours. Get ready, skanks! It's time for the truth train! Ahoy hoy? Weaseling out of things is important to learn. It's what separates us from the animals…except the weasel.</p>
			<p>Whoa, slow down there, maestro. There's a *New* Mexico? Uh, no, you got the wrong number. This is 9-1…2. Save me, Jeebus. I hope I didn't brain my damage. <strong> D'oh.</strong> <em> Stan Lee never left.</em> I'm afraid his mind is no longer in mint condition.</p>
			<h2>Mrs. Krabappel and Principal Skinner were in the closet making babies and I saw one of the babies and then the baby looked at me.</h2>
			<p>Uh, no, you got the wrong number. This is 9-1…2. Dad didn't leave… When he comes back from the store, he's going to wave those pop-tarts right in your face! Look out, Itchy! He's Irish! Homer no function beer well without.</p>
			<ol>
			<li>I hope I didn't brain my damage.</li><li>Your questions have become more redundant and annoying than the last three "Highlander" movies.</li><li>Oh, everything looks bad if you remember it.</li>
			</ol>

			<h3>Marge, it takes two to lie. One to lie and one to listen.</h3>
			<p>Don't kid yourself, Jimmy. If a cow ever got the chance, he'd eat you and everyone you care about! I prefer a vehicle that doesn't hurt Mother Earth. It's a go-cart, powered by my own sense of self-satisfaction.</p>
			<ul>
			<li>I didn't get rich by signing checks.</li><li>Well, he's kind of had it in for me ever since I accidentally ran over his dog. Actually, replace "accidentally" with "repeatedly" and replace "dog" with "son."</li><li>Stan Lee never left. I'm afraid his mind is no longer in mint condition.</li>
			</ul>

			<p>I hope I didn't brain my damage. Oh, a *sarcasm* detector. Oh, that's a *really* useful invention! Facts are meaningless. You could use facts to prove anything that's even remotely true! "Thank the Lord"? That sounded like a prayer. A prayer in a public school. God has no place within these walls, just like facts don't have a place within an organized religion.</p>
			<p>When will I learn? The answers to life's problems aren't at the bottom of a bottle, they're on TV! Son, a woman is like a beer. They smell good, they look good, you'd step over your own mother just to get one! But you can't stop at one. You wanna drink another woman!</p>
			<p>I'll keep it short and sweet — Family. Religion. Friendship. These are the three demons you must slay if you wish to succeed in business. Marge, it takes two to lie. One to lie and one to listen.</p>
			<p>Fire can be our friend; whether it's toasting marshmallows or raining down on Charlie. Aaah! Natural light! Get it off me! Get it off me! Uh, no, you got the wrong number. This is 9-1…2. Hi. I'm Troy McClure. You may remember me from such self-help tapes as "Smoke Yourself Thin" and "Get Some Confidence, Stupid!"</p>
			<p>But, Aquaman, you cannot marry a woman without gills. You're from two different worlds… Oh, I've wasted my life. Slow down, Bart! My legs don't know how to be as long as yours. Homer no function beer well without.</p>
			<p>Kids, we need to talk for a moment about Krusty Brand Chew Goo Gum Like Substance. We all knew it contained spider eggs, but the hantavirus? That came out of left field. So if you're experiencing numbness and/or comas, send five dollars to antidote, PO box… D'oh.</p>
			<p>Bart, with $10,000 we'd be millionaires! We could buy all kinds of useful things like…love! Marge, it takes two to lie. One to lie and one to listen. A woman is a lot like a refrigerator. Six feet tall, 300 pounds…it makes ice.</p>
			<p>I was saying "Boo-urns." Oh, everything looks bad if you remember it. Aaah! Natural light! Get it off me! Get it off me! When will I learn? The answers to life's problems aren't at the bottom of a bottle, they're on TV!</p>
			<p>I'm going to the back seat of my car, with the woman I love, and I won't be back for ten minutes! Stan Lee never left. I'm afraid his mind is no longer in mint condition. Our differences are only skin deep, but our sames go down to the bone.</p>
			<p>What good is money if it can't inspire terror in your fellow man? I was saying "Boo-urns." Here's to alcohol, the cause of — and solution to — all life's problems. Marge, it takes two to lie. One to lie and one to listen.</p>
			<p>Fat Tony is a cancer on this fair city! He is the cancer and I am the…uh…what cures cancer? Son, when you participate in sporting events, it's not whether you win or lose: it's how drunk you get.</p>

		<h1>Oh, everything looks bad if you remember it.</h1>
		<p>Oh, loneliness and cheeseburgers are a dangerous mix. Donuts. Is there anything they can't do? Fame was like a drug. But what was even more like a drug were the drugs. I'll keep it short and sweet — Family. Religion. Friendship. These are the three demons you must slay if you wish to succeed in business.</p>
		<p>You don't win friends with salad. Oh, so they have Internet on computers now! Beer. <strong> Now there's a temporary solution.</strong> <em> Facts are meaningless.</em> You could use facts to prove anything that's even remotely true!</p>
		<h2>Kids, you tried your best and you failed miserably. The lesson is, never try.</h2>
		<p>I hope this has taught you kids a lesson: kids never learn. Dear Mr. President, There are too many states nowadays. Please, eliminate three. P.S. I am not a crackpot. Old people don't need companionship. They need to be isolated and studied so it can be determined what nutrients they have that might be extracted for our personal use.</p>

		<li>I'm a Spalding Gray in a Rick Dees world.</li><li>Homer no function beer well without.</li><li>I was saying "Boo-urns."</li>

		<h3>You don't like your job, you don't strike. You go in every day and do it really half-assed. That's the American way.</h3>
		<p>I hope I didn't brain my damage. What good is money if it can't inspire terror in your fellow man? I don't like being outdoors, Smithers. For one thing, there's too many fat children. Son, when you participate in sporting events, it's not whether you win or lose: it's how drunk you get.</p>
		<ul>
		<li>Uh, no, you got the wrong number. This is 9-1…2.</li><li>Attempted murder? Now honestly, what is that? Do they give a Nobel Prize for attempted chemistry?</li><li>I've done everything the Bible says — even the stuff that contradicts the other stuff!</li>
		</ul>

		<p>Look out, Itchy! He's Irish! Your guilty consciences may make you vote Democratic, but secretly you all yearn for a Republican president to lower taxes, brutalize criminals, and rule you like a king! Don't kid yourself, Jimmy. If a cow ever got the chance, he'd eat you and everyone you care about!</p>
		<p>Bart, with $10,000 we'd be millionaires! We could buy all kinds of useful things like…love! Please do not offer my god a peanut. When will I learn? The answers to life's problems aren't at the bottom of a bottle, they're on TV!</p>

		<p>Kids, kids. I'm not going to die. That only happens to bad people. Fat Tony is a cancer on this fair city! He is the cancer and I am the…uh…what cures cancer? When will I learn? The answers to life's problems aren't at the bottom of a bottle, they're on TV!</p>

		<p>Please do not offer my god a peanut. Lisa, vampires are make-believe, like elves, gremlins, and Eskimos. Your guilty consciences may make you vote Democratic, but secretly you all yearn for a Republican president to lower taxes, brutalize criminals, and rule you like a king!</p>

		<p>I've had it with this school, Skinner. Low test scores, class after class of ugly, ugly children… You don't win friends with salad. I can't go to juvie. They use guys like me as currency. Ahoy hoy?</p>

		<p>Uh, no, they're saying "Boo-urns, Boo-urns." Human contact: the final frontier. D'oh. Our differences are only skin deep, but our sames go down to the bone. I hope this has taught you kids a lesson: kids never learn.</p>
		<p>How could you?! Haven't you learned anything from that guy who gives those sermons at church? Captain Whatshisname? We live in a society of laws! Why do you think I took you to all those Police Academy movies? For fun? Well, I didn't hear anybody laughing, did you? Except at that guy who made sound effects. Makes sound effects and laughs. Where was I? Oh yeah! Stay out of my booze. Marge, just about everything's a sin. Y'ever sat down and read this thing? Technically we're not supposed to go to the bathroom.</p>
